We are pleased to announce a release of embedded Arquillian container adapter for Weld.
This container has deserved some love for really long time.
We tried to refactor it and introduced new master branch which now corresponds to 2.0.0.x version stream.
The original master was branched in 1.0.
There is no more any `arquillian-weld-ee-embedded-1.1` or `arquillian-weld-se-embedded`.
It's squashed to one `arquillian-weld-embedded` and you can configure environments either programmatically or using configuration properties.
See link:https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-container-weld
This new version is going to be used in Weld as soon as possible.
