First version of the Jakarta EE TCKs has finally landed in Central and with that, we have re-enabled all remaining TCK tests and are confident enough to issue a candidate release for Weld 6!

Note that both, Weld API and Weld Core artifacts have been released.

Here is the list of changes from last Beta:

* Implement validation for unproxyability of sealed types (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2799[WELD-2799])
* Correct injection into `@Resource` fields of beans registered through extensions (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2798[WELD-2798])
* Improve the algorithm that determines `BeanManager` instance for synthetic beans coming from build compatible extensions (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2794[WELD-2794])
* Weld OSGi bundle now correctly exports `org.jboss.weld.util.reflection` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2793[WELD-2793])
* Weld OSGi bundle now contains imports for built-in bean proxies (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2796[WELD-2796])
* Re-introduce Jakarta EE CDI TCK into continuous integration (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2778[WELD-2778])
** The TCK artifact in Central is not yet final (it is `M1`) but it is enough to make sure Weld passes all related CDI tests with WildFly
* Fix possible file leak in `org.jboss.weld.util.ServiceLoader` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2800[WELD-2800])
** This was only reported during GlassFish testing and affected just Windows machines
* Resolve license conflict of `jboss-logging-processor` inside shaded Weld SE JAR (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2795[WELD-2795])

As per usual, please report any issues you discover with this release so that we can squash those bugs.
