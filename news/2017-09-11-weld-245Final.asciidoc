It's about time we delivered another regular bugfix release for Weld 2.
And while the list of fixes isn't exhausting, some of them are quite crucial.

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core:
** Revise Java 8 default methods plus proxies/sublasing behaviour (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2407[WELD-2407, window="_blank"] and link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2405[WELD-2405, window="_blank"])
** All POMs in Weld core project should now have correct MIME types; this corrects issues with Nexus 3 (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2417[WELD-2417, window="_blank"])
** Proxies for signed packages should now be generated in custom packages (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2402[WELD-2402, window="_blank"])
** The behaviour of Weld Core and integrator provided implementation of `org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Environment` is back to what it was in Weld 2.4.3.Final (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2401[WELD-2401, window="_blank"])
*** We found out this change could cause serious headaches to integrators so we will leave it as it is - sorry for the mess
*** For Weld 3, we already have a better solution in link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2398[place, window="_blank"]
* Weld SE and Servlet
** Both, Weld SE and Weld Servlet, will now explicitly bring in dependency on jboss-classfilewriter 1.2+ (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2406[WELD-2406, window="_blank"])
* Other
** Under the `jboss-as` directory of Weld source code, you can now make use of new profiles to create WildFly patches yourself link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2397[WELD-2397, window="_blank"]
