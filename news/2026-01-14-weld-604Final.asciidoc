New minor bugfix version of Weld 6 has landed in Central - say hello to Weld 6.0.4.Final.

There is only a handful on notable changes:

* Observable `Startup` and `Shutdown` events for web modules are now fired within a synchronized block, similarly to `@Initialized` events for application scope (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2827[WELD-2827])
* Weld SE `annotated` reflection discovery strategy was incorrectly recognizing classes with indirectly present bean defining annotations as valid beans (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2826[WELD-2826])
** For a class to be considered annotated with a bean defining annotation (for instance a scope), that annotation has to be *directly present* on the class; inheritance is not enough
** Note Jandex discovery was working correctly and is unaffected
* Fixed stack overflow error that could appear when `TRACE` logging was enabled and JSF was present (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2817[WELD-2817])
* Minor project adjustment to make it buildable with Java 25 (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2820[WELD-2820])
** Weld itself should run with Java 25 even on earlier versions, these changes were aimed at making the project build with it too
* Replace deprecated method usage from JBoss Logging (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2821[WELD-2821])
    
If you find any issues with the current release, don't hesistate to report them via usual channels.
