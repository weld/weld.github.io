Another quick turnaround as more integrators adopt Weld 5 and help us squash bugs.
Weld 5.0.0.SP2 is headed into Central as we speak.

The main reason for this service release is link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2721[WELD-2721] which was a spec violation in how `AfterBeanDiscovery` methods were treated outside of lifecycle observer method invocations.
Apart from that, there was also a corner case NPE during Weld Servlet and SE cooperation bootstrap (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2720[WELD-2720]).

As always, if there are more problems with Weld 5, let us know and we'll try to help.
