Weld 2.0.1.Final has been released. This is mainly a bug-fixing release with 20 issues fixed since the previous one. For details, see the link:/https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310891&version=12321507:[release notes].

Our focus is now shifting towards WildFly and its Weld integration in order to provide a CDI 1.1 compliant container. For details about CDI 1.1, see link:http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/CDI11Available[Pete's blog post]. Furthermore, we plan frequent releases of Weld to continue, so expect another release in early July at the latest!
