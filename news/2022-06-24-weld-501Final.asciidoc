Weld Core 5.0.1.Final is now available and comes with Weld API 5.0.SP2.

Main highlights are as follows:

* Updated all CDI related versions (API and TCKs) to their latest released variants and made sure we are passing
* Updated many other EE 10 APIs to their latest releases
* We are once again fully continuously testing against an EE container (nightly WildFly builds) which helped us polish more bumps in tests and code
* Tomcat 10.1 is available and supports EE 10, so we have upgraded to test against that and can therefore confirm our support for servlets is working well
* Jetty support is at the moment not verified as there is no public Jetty 12 release to test against
* Reviewed Servlet related parts of our documentation and updated them
* Reviewed Weld SE-Servlet cooperation and renewed continuous testing for it

As always, if you find further issues with Weld 5, let us know and we'll try to help.
