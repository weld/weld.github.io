Weld 5.1.2.Final has landed in Central and with it some new bufgixes.

Here is a summary of the changes:

* Avoid creation of duplicated thread groups on application re-deploy (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2755[WELD-2755])
** This could lead to a very tiny memory leak on repeated app re-deploy while on app servers (such as WildFly)
* `WeldInitialListener` can no longer throw `NullPointerException` if the application failed to start properly (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2752[WELD-2752])
* `WeldManager#getContexts` not properly returns empty collection when there is no context for given scope (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2761[WELD-2761])
* Fix client proxy creation for `@Typed` beans with package-protected types (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2758[WELD-2758])
* Weld project now uses unified and automatic formatting and import sorting that happens during build (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2753[WELD-2753])

As always, if you find further issues with Weld 5, let us know and we'll try to help.
