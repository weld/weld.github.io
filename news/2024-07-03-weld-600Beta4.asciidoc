New versions of Weld artifacts are now available in Central - Weld Core `6.0.0.Beta4` accompanied by Weld API `6.0.Beta5`.

Where applicable, `6.0.0.Beta4` bumps up Jakarta dependencies to their `Final` variants as well as implements remaining features from CDI spec, adds new Weld-specific API and addresses multiple backlog issues that were scheduled for this major release.

You might be wondering where did Betas 2 and 3 go. While you can find their artifacts in Central, they bear no difference from `Beta4` apart from not having separate distributable ZIP and docs.
With that in mind, below is the list of changes since Weld 6.0.0.Beta1:

* Added the ability to register Build Compatible Extension in Weld SE without discovery (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2772[WELD-2772])
* Use `Lock` instead of `synchronized` within `ContextualInstanceStrategy` to be more virtual thread-friendly (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2788[WELD-2788])
* Skip superclass declarations of final methods when creating proxies (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2785[WELD-2785])
* Observer method confiurator now correctly allow to override `Reception` settings without changing its `notify()` method (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2786[WELD-2786])
* Correct `CommonLogger` to mention correct GAV for Jandex (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2770[WELD-2770])
* Invoker API enhancements (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2780[WELD-2780])
** Proper exception handling
** Document API Weld offer above what CDI specification has; Weld retains all parts of the initial design CDI had
** Added benchmarks to have a measure of our implementation versus direct invocation
** Code cleanup and other minor tweaks
* Remove `SecurityManager` related code from Weld (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2789[WELD-2789])
** `SecurityManager` has been deprecated for quite a upcoming JDK versions plan to remove it completely so we remove it as part of the major release version
** This means Weld 6 no longer uses priviledged actions to perform various tasks, such as constructor invocations, reflection on classes etc.
* Remove `WARN` logging when an interceptor binding target of lifecycle interceptors targets anything other than `TYPE` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2790[WELD-2790])
* Revise Weld 6 examples; only keep essentials (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2771[WELD-2771])
* Address Weld API javadoc warning (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2779[WELD-2779])
* Revisit servlet setup and testing (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2784[WELD-2784])
* Clean up legacy Jetty integration parts (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2787[WELD-2787])


Note that the latest link:http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/6.0.0.Beta4/en-US/html_single/[documentation, window="_blank"] incorrectly states that it is for `SNAPSHOT` which isn't the case.
It is built for Beta4 but due to incorrect script setup the version number wasn't picked up properly.
This will be corrected for the next release.

As always, if you find further issues with Weld 6, let us know and we'll try to help.
