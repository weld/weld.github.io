CDI 4 has passed its Final ballot and is now available in Maven Central.
Some of you may have played with it already, but where is the fun in it, if you don't have a Final implementation, right?
Have no fear, Weld 5 Final is here!

As usual, there is Weld 5.0.Final API as well as Weld 5.0.0.Final core impl.

It is very much the same as CR2, with some additional tweaks and fixes that came to light when working on integrations within EE servers.
That's right, EE servers are already making progress towards integrating CDI 4 and Weld 5.
Folks over at Open Liberty did their Weld 5 homework about a week ago and WildFly now has a pending link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/15474[pull request] that adds missing bits for CDI 4 support.
It might still be a while before there is a Beta WildFly release, but if you have the nerves, you can build the SNAPSHOT at least.

Back on the topic of changes, here is a list of fixes from CR2 to Final:

* Self-interception can now be used on protected methods, params and return types (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2712[WELD-2712, window="_blank"])
* Rewieved Weld examples and made sure they run for EE 10 (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2708[WELD-2708, window="_blank"])
* Review Weld 5 documentation (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2696[WELD-2696, window="_blank"])
** Note that the servlet part is still outdated and being worked on as we need to see if there is workable EE 10 variant, see link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2716[WELD-2716, window="_blank"]
** We expect that this will be sorted by the time we ship 5.0.1.Final
* Firing of the `Startup` event for web modules can happen too early (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2717[WELD-2717, window="_blank"])
* Synthetic beans coming from Build Compatible extension should be registered under their respective extensions (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2718[WELD-2718, window="_blank"])
* Exceptions thrown during execution of Build Compatible extensions now correctly preserve their cause (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2710[WELD-2710, window="_blank"])
* Some of our SE testing was being skipped ever since Groovy dependency update, this is now corrected (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2714[WELD-2714, window="_blank"])
