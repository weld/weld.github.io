First small update for Weld 6 has landed in Central.

There are only two notable fixes here, so let us take a look at them:

* Fixed a bug that EJC (Eclipse Java Compiler) users can encounter in combination with interceptors and lambdas in their beans (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2806[WELD-2806])
** This could, in certain circumstances, yield a very hard to decipher bytecode generation error.
** Note that this does not manifest when using standard `javac` compiler.
** If you are interested in more gory details, they are in the issue and/or pull requests linked to it.
* Make `ElAwareBeanManager` injectable as a bean type
** Inability to perform this was an oversight as it is a requirement in Jakarta EE WebProfile specification.

As always, do report any bugs you encounter so that we can squash them as soon as possible!
