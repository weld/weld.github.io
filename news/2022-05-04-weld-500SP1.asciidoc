A new version of Weld core is now in Maven Central - 5.0.0.SP1.

There have been reports of a bytecode verification error in certain scenarios reported by link:https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cdi-dev/msg00586.html[GlassFish] and link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/15474#issuecomment-1113505376[WildFly] trying to integrate Weld 5.0.0.Final.
We have investigated the cause and identified the problematic change, you can read more about it in link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2719[WELD-2719].

Weld 5.0.0.SP1 release reverts the offending change (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2712[WELD-2712]) and otherwise keeps Weld intant in terms of changes.
In case you identify any further issues, don't hesitate to reach out.
