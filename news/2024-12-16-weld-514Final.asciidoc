A small update for Weld 5.1 (5.1.4.Final) has been released.

List of changes from 5.1.3.Final version:

* Fix resource injection into beans added via extensions (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2798[WELD-2798])
* Prevent file leak in Weld's `ServiceLoader` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2800[WELD-2800])
** Note that most environments were unaffected by this; the only reported issue was for testing setup of GlassFish on Windows machines
* Deprecate `WeldCrossContextFilter`, to be removed in Weld 6 (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2803[WELD-2803])
* Update custom TCK exclusion list used for `relaxed mode` testing (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2806[WELD-2806])
