Weld 3.0.2.Final is out and targetting WildFly 11!
Ever wished you could select events and instances in a truly generic way using just `java.lang.reflect.Type`?
Looking for easier way to configure SE container?
We have a bunch of bugfixes and improvements for you, so read on...

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core
** Improved subclass generation mechanism for generic interceptors (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2414[WELD-2414, window="_blank"])
** Fixed OSGi bundling, we missed out one package on last release (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2421[WELD-2421, window="_blank"])
** Improved behaviour with no-interface EJB view with non-public methods (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2430[WELD-2430, window="_blank"])
** Corrected proxy creation for signed classes (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2425[WELD-2425, window="_blank"])

* Weld SE
** There are now multiple convenient error-proof methods to quickly configure SE container (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2426[WELD-2426, window="_blank"])
*** `Weld.enableDevMode()`, `Weld.scanClasspathEntries()`, ...

* Weld API/SPI
** `WeldInstance` has several improvements
*** It now allows you to `select()` beans based on `java.lang.reflect.Type` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2427[WELD-2427, window="_blank"])
*** `WeldInstance.Handler` had become lazy which means you can now iterate/filter/sort `WeldInstance` without actually instantiating beans (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2258[WELD-2258, window="_blank"])
** There is new interface in the API - `WeldEvent` - which can be used in place of well known `Event` but allows you narrow down event type by using `select()` with `java.lang.reflect.Type` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2427[WELD-2427, window="_blank"])
** API now contains a `String` key used to obtain interceptors binding from `InvocationContext` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2436[WELD-2436, window="_blank"])

* Other
** Probe now correctly recognizes beans which have `@Priority` but aren't alternatives (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2432[WELD-2432, window="_blank"])
** Multiple documentation improvements regarding all things, old and new (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2440[WELD-2440, window="_blank"], link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2431[WELD-2431, window="_blank"], link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2434[WELD-2434, window="_blank"])
