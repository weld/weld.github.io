Another bug-smashing release has landed in Maven Central and this time it's Weld 5.1.1.SP2.

This is a very small but important change which addresses possible memory leak scenario (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2750[WELD-2750]).
There are multiple conditions for this leak to occur and while most applications are unlikely to be affected, it is still recommended to upgrade to this latest version.

As always, if you find further issues with Weld 5, do let us know.
