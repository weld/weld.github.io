A tiny update for Weld 5 has just been released.

We have identified a bug that EJC (Eclipse Java Compiler) users can encounter in combination with interceptors and lambdas in their beans and fixed it.
This could, in certain circumstances, yield a very hard to decipher bytecode generation error.

Note that never manifests when using standard `javac` compiler.
For those interested, the details are in the link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2806[WELD-2806 JIRA].
