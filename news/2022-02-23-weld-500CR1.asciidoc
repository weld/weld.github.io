Weld 5 now has its first candidate release; Weld API 5.0.CR1 and Weld Core 5.0.0.CR1 are headed towards Maven Central.

This release has only minor differences from the Beta but it is a testable basis for Final specification release.
Here is a quick overview:

* Correct default package detection inside `ProxyFactory` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2704[WELD-2704, window="_blank"])
* Use secure actions when obtaining constructors via reflection in `LiteExtensionTranslator` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2705[WELD-2705, window="_blank"])
* Dozens of dependabot updates for various dependencies
* Updated to the latest released CDI version (4.0.0-RC5) and latest CDI TCK version (4.0.0.RC6)
