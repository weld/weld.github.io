By now you might have heard that Red Hat announced significant changes to their middleware strategy last month. +
Let me start by saying that this has come as a surprise to us as we were not aware of it in advance. +
Nonetheless, here we are, and I wanted to provide Weld community with some context as well as talk about how this affects the project.

If you want to read the official announcement, it can be found on the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/evolving-our-middleware-strategy[Red Hat blog]. +
In short, some key points from the article are:

* Red Hatâ€™s Middleware and Integration Engineering and Products teams are moving to IBM in May/June 2025.
* Red Hat will continue to sell and support its Middleware and Integration offerings as they do today; this will not be impacted.
* All transitioning Red Hat technology will remain open source and continue to follow an upstream-first development model.

I do not anticipate this change having any significant impact on Weld project perhaps with the exception of a temporary disruption during the transition period. +
We remain committed to development of Weld as the compatible implementation of Jakarta CDI specification as well as its standalone capabilities. +
The project remains open source and contributions as well as bug reports are still very much welcome!

For Weld team +
Matej
