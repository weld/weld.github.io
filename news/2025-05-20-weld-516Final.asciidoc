Weld 5.1.6.Final is now headed towards Maven Central with a tiny fix for potential memory leak.

There was a very specific scenario possibly leading to a memory leak due to caching mismatch. +
Note that this only occured if the following conditions were met:

* Having a producer using `InterceptionFactory`
* Repeatedly creating those bean (most likely `@Dependent` beans)
* The underlying `AnnotatedType` backing this bean had to have an annotation with a non-empty array type value

Because this requires a very narrow set of conditions, it is reasonable to believe that most deployments are unaffected. +
That said, if you can upgrade, we definitely encourage you to!
