Weld 6.0.3.Final release is now available in Maven Central.

There are only two fixes to mention here:

* Added validation for interceptor classes declaring multiple methods for the same interception type (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2814[WELD-2814])
** This is a fail-fast(er) mechanism for users; otherwise the behavior is mandated by the Interceptors specification
* Correct `AnnotatedType` ID creation to avoid cache miss leading to possible memory leak (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2815[WELD-2815])
** The leak is not generic and doesn't affect most deployments. In fact it requires at least all of the below condition to start appearing:
*** Using CDI producers along with `InterceptionFactory`
*** Repeatedly creating these beans, so most likely `@Dependent` bean
*** And most importantly, the `AnnotatedType` backing the bean has to have an annotation with a non-empty array type value
** Even if this issue is unlikely to manifest, we recommend users to update their Weld version if possible
    
If you find any issues with the current release, don't hesistate to report them via usual channels.
