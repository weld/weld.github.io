A new version of Weld 5.1 has landed in Maven Central.

This is a bug squashing round which backports several notable fixes and changes from Weld 6 into Weld 5:

* Change `BeanManager` resolution process for `BuildCompatibleExtension` not belonging to any bean archive (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2794[WELD-2794])
* `LazySessionBeanStore` no longer swallows exceptions happening when attempting to initiate HTTP session (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2762[WELD-2762])
* Correct how we determine proxy package for beans with unassignable types in their bean type set (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2763[WELD-2763])
** This was only problematic in environments using WeldDefaultProxyServices to define their proxies (such as Weld SE)
* Correct `CommonLogger` to mention correct GAV for Jandex (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2770[WELD-2770])
* Added the ability to register Build Compatible Extension in Weld SE without discovery (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2772[WELD-2772])
* Correct inheritance of producer fields if there is an extension present (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2773[WELD-2773])
* Make sure `@Default` qualifier is added to events fired via `BeanManager#getEvent()` where appropriate (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2775[WELD-2775])
* Observer method confiurator now correctly allows to override `Reception` settings without changing its `notify()` method (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2786[WELD-2786])
* Clean up legacy Jetty integration parts (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2787[WELD-2787])
* Use `Lock` instead of `synchronized` within `ContextualInstanceStrategy` to be more virtual thread-friendly (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2788[WELD-2788])
* Skip superclass declarations of final methods when creating proxies (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2785[WELD-2785])
* Ensure OSGi bundle has access to all dependencies needed for built-in beans (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2796[WELD-2796])
