It's time for some minor updates and fixes, Weld 5.1.1.Final is now available!

Main highlights are as follows:

* Fix bean type assignability for beans with recursive generic types (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2738[WELD-2738])
* Failing validation for pasivation capability, Weld should throw `DeploymentException` instead of `DefinitionException` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2741[WELD-2741])
* Avoid firing `ProcessInjectionTarget` multiple times if a specialized bean was vetoed (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2742[WELD-2742])
* `BeanManager#getReference` should not create a child `CreationalContext` instance (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2743[WELD-2743])
** This should only affect scenarios in which beans were 'manually' created and destroyed in which case the destruction could end up incomplete
* Fix how Weld defines proxies to avoid problems in JDK 17+ along with the newest JBoss Class File Writer (1.3.0.Final) (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2744[WELD-2744])
* Correction to documentation which incorrectly suggested `@ManagedBean` was a bean defining annotation (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2737[WELD-2737])
