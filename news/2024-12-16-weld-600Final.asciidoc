Since there have been no further bugs reported, Weld `6.0.0.CR2` has evolved into its `Final` form.
Say hello to `Weld API 6.0.Final` as well as `Weld Core 6.0.0.Final`!

Since there are no changes from the previous `CR2` version, early adopters shouldn't encounter any unwelcome surprises.

Nonetheless, should you run into any bugs, do get in touch so that we can squash them as soon as possible!

And speaking of getting in touch, we recognize that JIRA can be a little daunting, so we are trying to make that easier by *enabling GitHub discussions*.
You can now ask your question in:

* link:https://github.com/weld/core/discussions[Weld Core] GH discussions
* link:https://github.com/weld/api/discussions[Weld API] GH discussions

And don't you worry, the `weld-dev` mailing list is still kicking plus, for the time being, we are still using JIRA for per-release issue tracking.
