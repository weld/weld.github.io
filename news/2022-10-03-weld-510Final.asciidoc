Weld Core 5.1.0.Final and Weld API 5.0.SP3 are now availabe in Maven Central.

Most notable change, which is also the cause of a minor version bump, is the removal of Weld Probe from our codebase.
Details are in link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2733[this JIRA issue, window="_blank)] and were also communicated via link:https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/weld-dev@lists.jboss.org/thread/I72EU5I746F4DESLSENJVZFAEFPHXJYV/[weld-dev email, window="_blank].

In short, Probe hasn't been maintained for a long time and its UI part is using outdated libraries and would need to be completely re-written which is something that we opted not to do at the moment.
The JIRA issue has more information as to how we could re-integrate it in the future if there is interest from the community.

WARNING: Probe removal affects any integrators that were using Probe up until now! This typically concerns EE integrators such as WildFly or Liberty.
