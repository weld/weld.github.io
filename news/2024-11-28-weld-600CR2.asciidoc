Turns out we forgot to perform some code cleanup in the `CR1` - so here goes `6.0.0.CR2` which removes deprecated code pieces.
Note that Weld API is unchanged; the only deprecations there are changes coming in recent CDI versions so we've kept that code around for now.

Resolved issues in this version:

* Revisit deprecated code in Weld Core (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2804[WELD-2804])
* Remove `WeldCrossContextFilter` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2803[WELD-2803])

As per usual, please report any issues you discover with this release so that we can squash those bugs.
