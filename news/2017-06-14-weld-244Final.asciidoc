We have been busy chasing down some annoying little bugs and it's high time you got the fruits of those efforts into your hands.
Say hello to Weld 2.4.4.Final.

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core
** Fixed bean discovery event ordering when processing producers (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2393[WELD-2393, window="_blank"])
** Eliminated an NPE for a corner case with abstract decorator (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2273[WELD-2273, window="_blank"])
** Corrected `@Initialized(RequestScoped.class)` event firing in `@PostConstruct` callbacks (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2372[WELD-2372, window="_blank"])
** Fixed `BeanManager.isStereotype()` behavior when checking a qualifier annotated with yet another qualifier (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2390[WELD-2390, window="_blank"])
* Weld SE
** Added a convenience static method `WeldContainer.current()`, a shortcut for `CDI.current()` with no need to cast the result (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2399[WELD-2399, window="_blank"])
** Allowed to specify bean discovery mode for synthetic archives (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2386[WELD-2386, window="_blank"])
** Fixed bean class discovery problem when adding whole packages (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2395[WELD-2395, window="_blank"])
* Weld Servlet
** Improved logging and make checks more lenient in case the container is not yet bootstrapped (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2382[WELD-2382, window="_blank"])
* Configuration options
** In SE and Servlet environments, Jandex can now be forcibly prohibited from processing your archives. This is useful when a third-party dependecy brings in some unsupported Jandex version (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2374[WELD-2374, window="_blank"])
* Development tools
** If a deployment validation fails and the development mode is enabled, a simple *validation HTML report* (which contains a lot of useful information) is generated
*** Users are encouraged to always attach this report when asking a question on the mailing list or any other communication channel
