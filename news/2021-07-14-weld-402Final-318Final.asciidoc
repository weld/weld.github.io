New maintenance releases for Weld 3 and 4 have been rolled out.

There is only a handful of changes this time so let's skid across them:

* Prevent `WeldInvocationContext` from ever returning `null` when queried for interceptor bindings (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2675[WELD-2675, window="_blank"])
* Fix an NPE if there is an EJB bean with default package present (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2674[WELD-2674, window="_blank"])
* Weld wasn't working on JDK 17 due to `jboss-classfilewriter` issue; this should no longer be the case (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2671[WELD-2671, window="_blank"])
* Correction to proxy name creation for producers based on interfaces - Weld should now use package and class of the most specific interface (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2675[WELD-2675, window="_blank"])
* Weld now provides correct metadata (via `@Decorated`) in cases where more than one decorator is applied to a single bean (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2673[WELD-2673, window="_blank"])
* We have decided to no longer provide WildFly patches for each release (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2660[WELD-2660, window="_blank"])
** After discussion with WildFly team, we figured the current way is not going to work for anything beyond Weld 3
** And we aren't even certain this feature is requested and/or used anymore; if you feel otherwise, please create a JIRA to let us know
