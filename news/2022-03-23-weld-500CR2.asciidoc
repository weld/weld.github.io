Final ballot of CDI 4 has uncovered untested and unimplemented area in the newly added `Startup` and `Shutdown` events.

Our previous release was guilty of not supporting this properly, hence here comes Weld API 5.0.CR2 and Weld Core 5.0.0.CR2.

Weld now automatically fires these events and the JIRA issue for this can be seen link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2709[here (WELD-2709), window="_blank"].
However, integrators can choose to override this behavior and fire both events themselves in case there is more bootstrapping logic that needs to come together before the container is deemed ready.
The API interface link:https://github.com/weld/api/blob/5.0.CR2/weld-spi/src/main/java/org/jboss/weld/bootstrap/api/Environment.java#L48-L70[`org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Environment`] allows implementors to override a specific method which will then prevent Weld from handling these events.
