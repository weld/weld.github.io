First release of Weld 7, a CDI 5.0 compatible implementation, has landed in Central. +
Look for Weld Core 7.0.0.Alpha1 and Weld API 7.0.Alpha4!

What's new in this CDI version?

* First of all, starting with CDI 5.0.Alpha3 (released after M1), the artifacts have new coordinates which this Weld release consumes
** The group ID has changed from `jakarta.enterprise` to `jakarta.cdi` so it is now in line with other Jakarta projects
** The artifact IDs are always in the form of `jakarta.cdi-[something]`; the basic CDI API artifact ID is now `jakarta.cdi-api`
** CDI also provides relocation artifacts meaning users will be able to keep consuming the old coordinates but a warning during their build will help them migrate to new artifacts
* Added implementation of the newly introduced `@Reserve` concept (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2824[WELD-2824])
* Implement client proxy unwrapping API (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2823[WELD-2823])
* Lang model implementation now supports records and sealed classes (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2809[WELD-2809] and link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WELD-2810[WELD-2810])
